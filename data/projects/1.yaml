description: I was honoured to get the opportunity to teach a <a href="https://macdonst.github.io/wwc-london-star-track/">PhoneGap Beginner workshop</a> along with Anis and Suraj to the members of the Women Who Code London chapter. We may not have gotten as far along as we all wanted to but we still had fun.
