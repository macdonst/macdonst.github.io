description: This is one of my favourite talks to give. The <a href="https://js-speech-rec.herokuapp.com/">slides</a> are a live demo of the capabilities of speech recognition in the browser. On this particular day I was coming down with the flu and suffering from wild temperature swings which is why I have a coat on indoors in Raleigh, NC.
